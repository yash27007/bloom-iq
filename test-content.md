# Computer Networks - Unit 1

## Introduction to Computer Networks

Computer networks are interconnected computing devices that can exchange data and share resources. A computer network is a digital telecommunications network which allows nodes to share resources.

### Key Components

1. **Nodes**: End devices such as computers, servers, and mobile devices
2. **Links**: Physical connections between nodes (cables, wireless)
3. **Protocols**: Rules governing communication between network devices
4. **Network Interface Cards (NICs)**: Hardware components that enable network connectivity

### Network Types

#### Local Area Network (LAN)
- Covers a small geographic area
- High data transfer rates
- Low latency
- Examples: Office networks, home networks

#### Wide Area Network (WAN)
- Covers large geographic areas
- Lower data transfer rates compared to LAN
- Higher latency
- Examples: Internet, corporate networks spanning cities

#### Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)
- Covers a city or metropolitan area
- Intermediate between LAN and WAN
- Examples: City-wide networks, campus networks

### Network Topologies

#### Bus Topology
- All devices connected to a single cable
- Simple and cost-effective
- Single point of failure

#### Star Topology
- All devices connected to a central hub
- Easy to troubleshoot
- Central hub is single point of failure

#### Ring Topology
- Devices connected in a circular fashion
- Data travels in one direction
- Failure of one device affects entire network

#### Mesh Topology
- Multiple connections between devices
- Highly reliable
- Expensive to implement

### OSI Model

The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is a conceptual framework with seven layers:

1. **Physical Layer**: Transmission of raw bits
2. **Data Link Layer**: Error detection and correction
3. **Network Layer**: Routing and addressing
4. **Transport Layer**: End-to-end communication
5. **Session Layer**: Session management
6. **Presentation Layer**: Data encryption and compression
7. **Application Layer**: User interface

### TCP/IP Model

The TCP/IP model has four layers:

1. **Link Layer**: Network interface
2. **Internet Layer**: IP addressing and routing
3. **Transport Layer**: TCP and UDP protocols
4. **Application Layer**: HTTP, FTP, SMTP, etc.

### Network Security

Network security involves protecting data and resources from unauthorized access:

- **Firewalls**: Control network traffic
- **Encryption**: Protect data confidentiality
- **Authentication**: Verify user identity
- **Access Control**: Limit resource access

### Conclusion

Computer networks are essential for modern communication and resource sharing. Understanding network fundamentals, topologies, and protocols is crucial for network design and management.
