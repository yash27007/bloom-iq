# ✅ System Status Report - Question Paper Generation Platform

## Issues Fixed

### 1. 🐛 NaN Error in Admin Dashboard
**Problem**: Admin dashboard showed "NaN" for Course Materials count
**Root Cause**: API was returning `materials` in `_count` but frontend expected `courseMaterials`
**Solution**: 
- Updated API endpoint to return `courseMaterials` in the count
- Added safety checks in frontend to handle undefined values

### 2. 🔧 Question Generation Authentication Issue
**Problem**: Question generation jobs were failing with 401 errors due to authentication issues
**Root Cause**: tRPC route was making API calls without proper session context
**Solution**: 
- Refactored to call processing function directly instead of making HTTP requests
- Exported `processQuestionGeneration` function for direct imports
- Added proper error handling and job status updates
